# Express Note Taker 
[Deployed](www.google.com) | [Demonstration](www.google.com)

# Description
a web application that allows users to save and edits notes 


# How it Works
this app uses a REST API connected to the mongoose ODM to perform CRUD operations for manipulating the users' notes. I used an exprerss server as the controller for the application and built the front-end with the bootstrap CSS framework. I used webpack to bundle the build

# Usage 
Because this application does not have authentication I am not currently allowing people to visit the page. However, you can view the demonstration to see how it works!
